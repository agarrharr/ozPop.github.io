I enjoy doing things well and consider myself to be a lifelong learner. Minimum effort to get by is not what I am about. I believe there is always more to know, and that excellence is a goal worth reaching for. I want to be involved in a pursuit that always leaves me room to grow.

I want to be creative while also being invested in an endeavor that is progressive and technology oriented. I have always been interested in science fiction, because it shows us what the world could be, rather than what it currently is. I see the world around me changing and growing, and things that seemed impossible are now becoming reality. But I don't just want to see it happen, I want to make it happen. This is what drew me to web development.

Being involved in a web related line of work provides plenty of opportunity to be constantly learning, working on things that matter to people and making a difference. As I move forward, I aim to better understand how the web works and to learn how to take advantage of this technology to create things that are both interesting and useful.

For the past several months, I have been completing the full stack web development program at the Flatiron School. I have been focused on developing a competency with various web technologies in an effort to jumpstart a career in web development.
