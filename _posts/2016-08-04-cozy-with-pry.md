Moving beyond the basics.

_Target audience:_ Individuals who have some experience with using Pry, Object 
Oriented Ruby.

Discussion points:

* Running shell commands from Pry console
* Editing code from within Pry session
* Using `gist` to create snippets
* Exploring contexts

### Running shell commands

You can run the usual shell commands by using dot notation. That is, by prefacing 
a particular command with a dot while in Pry. E.G.: `.ls`, `.cat`, `.pwd`

### Editing code

You can edit code from within a Pry session. To do that we use the `edit` 
command. For example, lets edit a class method called `list_animal_types`. Watch
the video below for a quick example of that workflow. (SAVED VIDEO TO DOWNLOADS)

### Using gist to create snippets from pry
    * using -l to show line numbers



### Exploring contexts

* what is context?
    * how to load class contexts
        * using require_relative './config/evironment.rb' (img already saved)
    * examples of main context
    * class context
    * instance of class context
* requiring objects
* moving around in different scopes
* showing nesting
* jumpt-to specific scope
