_Learning To Embrace The Way Of The Crowbar_

_Target audience:_ Individuals who have some experience with using Pry, Object 
Oriented Ruby.

**Discussion points:**

* Running shell commands from Pry console
* Editing code from within Pry session
* Using `gist` to create snippets
* Exploring Pry contexts

<br>

### Running shell commands

----

You can run the usual shell commands by using dot notation. That is, by prefacing 
a particular command with a dot while in Pry. E.G.: `.ls`, `.cat`, `.pwd`.

This is particularly helpful if you need to edit or move files on the fly without
leaving the Pry session.

Watch the video for a quick example:

{% youtube -7cNsFJ8gGc %}

<br>

### Editing code

----

You can edit code from within a Pry session. To do that we use the `edit` 
command. Just point the command to a whole file or tell Pry you want to edit a 
specific method.

_NOTE:_ Please edit your _~/.pryrc_ file and specify your desired editor. In the
case of sublime, just add:

`Pry.config.editor = 'sublime -n'` (the `-n` flag will open a new sublime window
every time you use the `edit` command)

_NOTE#2:_ Upon closing the window, notice that Pry reloads your changes 
automatically and those changes are immediately reflected in the current Pry 
session.

For example, lets edit a class method called `list_animal_types` in which we 
correct some code. Watch the video below for a quick example of that work flow.

### Using gist

----

We can create snippets of code without leaving Pry console using the `gist` 
command. Pry pushes code to [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) on the fly
and provides a link to that gist.

_NOTE:_ In order to be able to use this feature you may have to install the 
**gist gem**. Just run `gem install gist` in case you don't have the gem and 
want to use this feature.

_NOTE#2:_ I am using `-l` flag at the end in order to display line numbers.

### Exploring Pry contexts

----

#### What is a context? 

I found it helpful to think of context as visibility of **"entities"**,
entities being a variable, method, class, object, or file. In Prys' case, 
it is usually objects. For the purpose of relating to something familiar, it may 
also be helpful to think of context as scope.

When you start Pry from the terminal, outside the scope of a class or outside 
any given projects explicit environment, Pry will start in default context 
known as `main`.

The `main` context, by default, gives you access to various built in ruby objects.

![Main context example](http://i.imgur.com/wYpsHZM.png)

We can also start Pry in locations where it has access to other contexts such as, 
_our own classes_ or _objects that we bring into our projects via various gems_. 
You may have seen this example in practice when using `binding.pry`.

In addition to starting Pry in specific locations that give access to those 
contexts, we can bring contexts into our Pry session.

For example, we can load class contexts into a Pry session using `require_relative`.

![Require relative farmer class](http://i.imgur.com/tOhz8eH.png)

Or we can require the whole environment! This will gives us access to all of 
the contexts.

_NOTE:_ If you use the `edit` command to edit a particular class, the class 
context becomes available automatically.

<p></p>

#### Starting in a particular context

We can start Pry within a class context or within an instance of a class. when 
we insert a `binding.pry` or `Pry.start` inside the class itself.

_NOTE:_ Keep in mind that when execution hits `Pry.start` it starts a new session!

Lets use `binding.pry` of our example.

### Listing contents and moving around contexts

Using commands like `cd` and `ls` we can move in and out of contexts or inspect 
those contexts. The behavior of these two commands is similar to how they behave
in bash. `cd` can be used to move in and out of contexts (objects or scopes) and 
`ls` is useful when inspecting the contents of said entities.

When we move into different contexts (e.g.: classes) Pry is keeping track of 
where we are. We can inspect how deeply nested we are by invoking a command 
called `nesting`.

Using `jumpt-to` command we can quickly move around different contexts that we
are _nested_ in.

View the below video for examples how these commands work:

### Summary and other tips

1. You can run the usual shell commands using the `.` dot notation while in Pry.
2. Use the `edit` command to quickly jump into an editor and make changes to
your code.
3. Take advantage of the `gist` command to quickly create and share snippets.
4. Understand Prys' contexts and how to navigate them.

Getting involved with Pry and Prys' more advanced features has proven to be 
invaluable to me. I rely on Pry a lot in order to make sense of what is happening
in the code I am working with at any given time. I highly recommend that you review 
Pry documentation and related resources in order to become more familiar with 
this awesome tool.


#### Other useful related tips:

Made a typo while writing a method in Pry?

* Explore how `show-input` works and how to `amend-line #`.

_NOTE:_ Clear input buffer with `!` and check out what searching `history` is.


##### Remember, when bugs surface, you can't go wrong by choosing a crowbar.
